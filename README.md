##  Covid  Detection Using X-Ray Plates

## Problem Satement:
It aims to classify X-ray images of patients into two classes: normal and COVID-19 positive cases. X-ray images are an essential diagnostic tool for identifying potential cases of COVID-19, and this automated system will aid healthcare professionals in making quicker and more accurate decisions.


## Proposed Solution:
To address the challenge of COVID-19 detection through X-ray images, we propose transfer learning based efficient and accurate COVID Detection System (CDS). The primary goal of this system is to minimize false predictions while identifying COVID-19 positive cases correctly.
